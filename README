== About ==

Gospeed is a library of micro-benchmarks for Go which evolved from the GoLightly project. It's main
utility is for understanding and reasoning about the performance of Go programs.


== Usage ==

Download the repo to a convenient location in your $GOPATH and then run the benchmarks with:

	go test -v -test.bench=".*" -test.timeout="60m"

the sixty minute timeout may be necessary when running the entire benchmark suite or portions which
make significant use of channels as the default aggregate test timeout is ten minutes.
