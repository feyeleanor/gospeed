== About ==

GoSpeed is a library of micro-benchmarks for Go which evolved from the GoLightly project. It's main
utility is for understanding and reasoning about the performance of Go programs.


== Usage ==

Download the repo to a convenient location in your $GOPATH

	git clone git@github.com:feyeleanor/gospeed.git

or install it to pkg/mod

	go get github.com/feyeleanor/GoSpeed

On macOS/Linux run the benchmarks with:

	go test -test.bench=".*"

or on Windows

	go test -bench .*

If you're running on older hardware such as an Intel Atom N270 netbook (which the early versions of
GoSpeed were developed on) then you may also need to add a custom timeout to complete benchmarks
which make significant use of channels as the default aggregate test timeout is ten minutes.

On macOS/Linux

	go test -test.bench=".*" -test.timeout="60m"

on Windows

	go test -bench .* -timeout 60m
