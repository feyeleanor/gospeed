== About ==

GoSpeed is a library of micro-benchmarks for Go which evolved from the GoLightly project. It's main
utility is for understanding and reasoning about the performance of Go programs.


== Usage ==

Download the repo to a convenient location in your $GOPATH and then run the benchmarks with:

	go test -test.bench=".*"

If you're running on older hardware such as an Intel Atom N270 netbook (which the early versions of
GoSpeed were developed on) then you may also need to add a custom timeout to complete benchmarks
which make significant use of channels as the default aggregate test timeout is ten minutes.

	go test -test.bench=".*" -test.timeout="60m"


== Limitations ==

With releases of Go prior to 1.16 GoSpeed could be fetched with

	go get github.com/feyeleanor/GoSpeed

however this is no longer the case.
